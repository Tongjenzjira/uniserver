## UniController
The UniController is the heart of the UniformServer Package wher everything can be controlled, modified and updated. It is built using Pascal and compiled with Lazurus 2.0.10.

### Create working environment

Create a working environment for compiling and testing code:

 1. Create a new folder for example z_controller
 2. Download the latest version of Uniform Server ZeroXI 
    for example 14_0_3_ZeroXIV.exe and save to folder z_controller
 3. Double click on downloaded file (14_0_3_ZeroXIV.exe) this extracts Uniform Server ZeroXI
 4. Download the source from Githun to the folder z_controller 
 5. Note: Two new folders are created synapse and unicon_images
          Project source code is added to folder z_controller.
 6. That completes working environment creation.
 
###  Compiling UniController

With the working environment in place you are ready to compile UniController as follows:
 
 1. Start Lazarus
 2. Close any existing projects: Project > Close Project
 3. In the pop-up window click "Open Projects" button 
    Navigate to folder: z_controller\UniServerZ
    Click on file UniController.lpi, click Open Button.
    The projects opens and is ready for compiling.
 4. A quick test run the project: Run > run or press F9
    Note: Synapse will produce several warning Hint messages these are not errors.
    Last line displayed, Project "UniController" successfully built
 5. UniController will run.

 You can now change code as required and re-compile.
